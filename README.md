# xfready2 
> made with ❤ ️by Fready
The code of our chrome extension in all its glory

### [ Demo ](https://freadyapp.github.io/xfready2)


## First time:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:robo-monk/xfready2.git
cd xfready2
pnpm dev -r # reload dependencies
```

* Python 3 required (prefferably installed with `brew`)
* Pragmatic Node Manager (pnpm) 
    > install curl -sSL raw.githubusercontent.com/robo-monk/pnpm/master/copy%2Bpaste.py | python3 - && zsh

## Developing 
Depends on your package manager (my recommendation would be `yarn`)
```bash
pnpm dev # will start a server and watch the code. Will
         # also check whether tests pass if configed so;
```
