            Fready respects and is committed to protecting your personal information. Our privacy policy reflects
            current
            global
            principles and standards on handling personal information – notice and choice of data use, data access and
            integrity,
            security, onward transfer and enforcement/oversight. This online privacy policy applies only to information
            collected
            through our Website or Web app and not to information collected offline. By using our Web app, the Website,
            the
            Google
            Chrome Extension or by accessing any piece of communication material created by the Software you consent to
            this
            privacy
            policy. Fready may change this privacy policy and you are urged to review them on a regular basis. If you
            continue to
            use our Website after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are
            significant, we
            may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by law.
            <br><br><strong>Definitions</strong><br>
            These definitions should help you understand this policy. When we say “we,” “us,” “our,” and “Fready,” we
            are
            referring
            to Fready. We provide online platforms that you may use to market to or stay in contact with others,
            including
            creating,
            and promoting marketing messages and other information related to your Visitors (the “Services”). When we
            say
            “User,” we
            are referring to the person or entity that is registered with us to use the Services. When we say “you,” we
            are
            referring either to a User or to some other person who visits any of our Websites. A “Visitor” is a person
            who
            visits
            your website and interacts with our Services. “Personal Information” means any information that identifies
            or
            can be
            used to identify you or a Visitor, directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, first and last
            name,
            date of
            birth, email address, gender, occupation or other demographic information.
            ‍
            We offer the Services on at least our website fready.co, our Web app and our Google Chrome Extension. This
            Privacy
            Policy applies to these specific websites, as well as any other sites or applications owned or operated by
            us
            (each a
            “Website” and together the “Websites”). The “Websites” include the Websites themselves, and any web pages,
            interactive
            features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, social network “tabs,” or other online, mobile, or
            wireless
            offerings that post a link to this Privacy Policy, whether accessed via computer, mobile device, or other
            technology,
            manner or means. While providing the Services, and as described in more detail below, we may collect
            Personal
            Information about a Website visitor, User, person or email address on or related to a Visitor List, or
            Visitor.
            The
            “Google Chrome Extension” refers to the Google Chrome Browser add-on which can be found on the Google Chrome
            Web
            Store
            https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions .
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>We collect the following information:</strong><br>
            ‍
            1. Information you voluntarily provide to us: When you sign up for and use the Services, consult with our
            customer
            service team, send us an email, post on our blog, integrate the Services with another website or service
            (for
            example,
            when you choose to connect your Google Chrome Browser account with Fready), or communicate with us in any
            way,
            you are
            voluntarily giving us information that we collect. That information may include either your or your
            Visitors’
            name,
            physical address, email address, IP address, phone number, credit card information, as well as details
            including
            gender,
            occupation, location, purchase history, and other demographic information. By giving us this information,
            you
            consent to
            this information being collected, used, disclosed, as described in our Terms of Service and in this Privacy
            Policy.
            ‍
            2. The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically
            identify
            you as a
            unique person) or "non‐personally identifiable" (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We
            use
            both
            types of information, and combinations of both types, as described below.
            ‍
            3. Whenever you use our web application there's certain information that gets created and recorded in an
            automated way.
            This information we collect includes:
            ‍
            a. Log Data. When you use our web application our servers automatically record information about your
            interaction with
            our Services ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever you use it to access our
            Website. This
            log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before
            you
            came to
            our Website, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used the web
            application.
            We may
            also use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your
            Fready
            account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use
            "session"
            cookies
            (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete
            them). For
            example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Fready settings so you don't have to
            set
            them up
            every time you visit our web application.
            ‍
            b. Information on the visitors interacting with our Services including information such as: a) name, b)
            email,
            c) social
            profile.
            ‍
            c. Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're
            using
            Fready app
            on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device
            identifiers,
            and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device
            you're
            using and
            its settings.
            ‍
            d. Social Profile. In addition to the core data, we also collect information about the social profile of the
            user, such
            as FacebookID or TwitterID. We utilize that data to uniquely identify leads and avoid duplications in our
            Database.
            Users have the absolute right to delete all their leads throughout our Web App.
            ‍
            We may collect this information as a part of log files as well as through the use of cookies or other
            tracking
            technologies. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed more below, and in more detail
            in
            our
            Cookie Statement.
            ‍
            4. Cookies and tracking: We may use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our
            Services, and
            this may include using cookies and similar tracking technologies on our Website, such as pixels and web
            beacons,
            to
            analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, serve targeted
            advertisements, and
            gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the
            individual
            browser level. We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website or to manage and serve
            our
            advertising on other sites. For more information about our use of cookies and other tracking technologies,
            as
            well as
            how to opt out of the use of cookies, please refer to our Cookie Statement.
            ‍
            5. Web beacons: We use web beacons on our Websites, emails and widgets. When we send emails to our users, we
            may
            track
            behavior such as who opened the emails and who clicked the links. This allows us to measure the performance
            of
            our email
            campaigns and to improve our features for specific segments of Users. To do this, we include single pixel
            gifs,
            also
            called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the
            email, your
            IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the
            emails we
            deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create reports about how your email campaign
            performed and
            what actions your Visitors took. Reports are also available to us when we send email to you, so we may
            collect
            and
            review that information.
            ‍
            6. Information from other sources: From time to time we may obtain information about you or your Visitors
            from
            third
            party sources, such as public databases, social media platforms, third party data providers and our joint
            marketing
            partners. We take steps to ensure that such third parties are legally permitted or required to disclose such
            information
            to us. Examples of the information we may receive from other sources include: demographic information,
            device
            information (such as IP addresses), location, and online behavioral data (such as information about your use
            of
            social
            media websites, page view information and search results and links). We use this information, alone or in
            combination
            with other information (including Personal Information) we collect, to enhance our ability to provide
            relevant
            marketing
            and content to you and to develop and provide you with more relevant product features, and services.

            emails by
            following the unsubscribe instructions included in every email we send. In addition, we may use information

            are
            governed
            by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.
            ‍
            c. Links to third-party websites. Our Websites include links to other websites, whose privacy practices may
            be
            different
            from ours. If you submit Personal Information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their
            privacy
            policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Website you visit.
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>Third Parties</strong><br>
            We may disclose Personal Information to the following types of third parties for the purposes described in
            this
            policy:
            ‍
            a. Service Providers. Sometimes, we share your information with our third party Service Providers, who help
            us
            provide
            and support our Services. Examples of Service Providers include payment processors, hosting services and
            content
            delivery services.
            ‍
            b. Advertising partners. We may partner with third party advertising networks and exchanges to display
            advertising on
            our Websites or to manage and serve our advertising on other sites and may share Personal Information with
            them
            for this
            purpose. All third parties with which we share this information are required to use your Personal
            Information in
            a
            manner that is consistent with this policy. We and our third party partners may use cookies and other
            tracking
            technologies, such as pixels and web beacons, to gather information about your activities on our Websites
            and
            other
            sites in order to provide you with targeted advertising based on your browsing activities and interests.
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>Contests and Sweepstakes</strong><br>
            We may, from time to time, offer surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions on our Websites or
            through
            social
            media (collectively “Our Promotions”). Participation in our Promotions is completely voluntary. Information
            requested
            for entry may include personal contact information such as your name, address, date of birth, phone number,
            email
            address, username, and similar details. We use the information you provide to administer Our Promotions. We
            may
            also,
            unless prohibited by the Promotion’s rules or law, use the information provided to communicate with you, or
            other people
            you select, about our Services. We may share this information with our affiliates and other organizations or
            Service
            Providers in line with this policy and the rules posted for the Promotion.
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong><br>
            We are committed to protecting your personal information against unauthorized use or disclosure. We
            implement a
            variety
            of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you access your personal
            information. We
            do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This
            does
            not
            include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Website, conducting our business, or servicing
            you,
            so long
            as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we
            believe
            release is appropriate to comply with the law, regulation or legal request; enforce our site policies or
            protect
            ours or
            others rights, property or safety or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
            issues.
            However non‐personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing or
            other
            uses. We
            may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or
            proceeding that
            involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy.
            ‍
            Our databases and offices are located in Europe but our servers are located worldwide, so your information
            may
            be
            transferred to, stored, or processed worldwide. According to GDPR and other applicable laws, we take many
            steps
            to
            protect your privacy, including offering a data processing addendum. By using our websites, you understand
            and
            consent
            to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information to our facilities and those third
            parties with
            whom we share it as described in our Terms of Use.
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>Other Data Protection Rights</strong><br>
            ‍
            You have the following data protection rights:
            ‍
            1. To access, correct, update, or request deletion of your Personal Information. Fready takes reasonable
            steps
            to ensure
            that the data we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and up to date. You may
            contact
            us
            directly at any time about accessing, correcting, updating, or deleting your Personal Information, or
            altering
            your data
            or marketing preferences by emailing us at hellofready@gmail.com. We will consider your request in
            accordance
            with
            applicable laws.
            ‍
            In addition, if you are a resident of the EEA, you can object to processing of your Personal Information,
            ask us
            to
            restrict processing of your Personal Information or request portability of your Personal Information. Again,
            you
            can
            exercise these rights by emailing us at hellofready@gmail.com
            ‍
            2. Similarly, if we have collected and processed your Personal Information with your consent, then you can
            withdraw your
            consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted
            prior to
            your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful
            processing
            grounds other than consent.
            ‍
            3. You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your
            Personal
            Information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for
            data
            protection authorities in the EEA are available here.
            ‍
            We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in
            accordance
            with applicable data protection laws. We may ask you to verify your identity in order to help us respond
            efficiently to
            your request.
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>How We Share Information</strong><br>
            ‍
            We may share and disclose your Personal Information to the following types of third parties for the purposes
            described
            in this privacy policy (for purposes of this section, "you" and "your" refer to Users, and Visitors unless
            otherwise
            indicated):
            ‍
            1. Our service providers: Sometimes, we share your information with our third-party service providers, who
            help
            us
            provide and support our Services and other business-related functions. Examples include analyzing data,
            hosting
            data,
            engaging technical support for our Services, processing payments, and delivering content.
            ‍
            2. Advertising partners: We may partner with third-party advertising networks and exchanges to display
            advertising on
            our Websites or to manage and serve our advertising on other sites and may share Personal Information with
            them
            for this
            purpose. We and our third-party partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as pixels and
            web
            beacons, to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to provide you
            with
            targeted advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. For more information about cookies and
            other
            tracking technologies, please see our Cookie Statement.
            ‍
            3. Any competent law enforcement body, regulatory body, government agency, court or other third party where
            we
            believe
            disclosure is necessary (a) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (b) to exercise, establish, or
            defend
            our legal
            rights, or (c) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.
            ‍
            4. A potential buyer (and its agents and advisors) in the case of a sale, merger, consolidation,
            liquidation,
            reorganization, or acquisition. In that event, any acquirer will be subject to our obligations under this
            privacy
            policy, including your rights to access and choice. We will notify you of the change either by sending you
            an
            email or
            posting a notice on our Website.
            ‍
            5. Any other person with your consent.
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA Persons Only)</strong><br>
            ‍
            If you are from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal
            Information
            described
            above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
            ‍
            However, we will normally collect and use Personal Information from you where the processing is in our
            legitimate
            interests and not overridden by your data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
            Typically,
            our
            legitimate interests include improving, maintaining, providing, and enhancing our technology, products, and
            services;
            ensuring the security of the Services and our Websites; and for our marketing activities.
            If you are a User, we may need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you. In some limited
            cases,
            we may
            also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you. If we ask you to provide Personal
            Information to
            comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant
            time
            and
            advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not, as well as of the
            possible
            consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information.
            ‍
            Where required by law, we will collect Personal Information only where we have your consent to do so.

            <br><br><strong>Your Choices and Opt-Outs</strong><br>
            Users and Website visitors who have opted in to our marketing emails or Facebook Messenger notifications can
            opt
            out of
            receiving marketing emails or Messenger notifications from us at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link
            at
            the
            bottom of our marketing messages or writing “Unsubscribe” or “Stop” on Messenger.

            Also, all opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at hellofready@gmail.com. Please note that some
            communications
            (such as service messages, account notifications, billing information) are considered transactional and
            necessary for
            account management, and Users cannot opt out of these messages unless you cancel your Fready account.
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>Our Security</strong><br>
            We take appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Information
            from
            loss,
            misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved
            in
            the
            processing and the nature of the Personal Information. If you have any questions about the security of your
            Personal
            Information, you may contact us at hellofready@gmail.com.
            ‍
            Fready accounts may require a username and password to log in if chosen by the user over a third party
            option
            such as
            “Google Sign-In” . Users must keep their username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third
            party.
            Because
            the information in a User’s Fready account is so sensitive, account passwords are hashed, which means we
            cannot
            see a
            Fready’ password. We cannot resend forgotten passwords either. We will only provide Users with instructions
            on
            how to
            reset them.
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>What choices do you have about your information?</strong><br>
            ‍
            If you have a Fready account, many of the choices you have about your information are built directly into
            the
            product or
            your account settings. For example, you can:
            ‍
            1. Access and change information in your profile page at any time, and choose whether your profile page is
            available to
            search engines;
            ‍
            2. Link or unlink your Fready account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For
            some
            services
            (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on Fready to that service.
            ‍
            3. Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we'll deactivate it and remove your content
            from
            our Web
            Application. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business
            purposes
            (including to help address fraud and spam).
            ‍
            4. You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access our Web
            application.
            For
            example: The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local
            data
            storage;
            To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider.
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>Retention of Data</strong><br>
            We retain Personal Information where we have an ongoing legitimate business or legal need to do so. Our
            retention
            periods will vary depending on the type of data involved, but, generally, we'll refer to these criteria in
            order
            to
            determine retention period:
            ‍
            1. Whether we have a legal or contractual need to retain the data.
            2. Whether the data is necessary to provide our Services.
            3. Whether our Users have the ability to access and delete the data within their Fready accounts.
            4. Whether our Users would reasonably expect that we would retain the data until they remove it or until
            their
            Fready
            accounts are closed or terminated.
            ‍
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete
            or
            anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in
            backup
            archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing
            until
            deletion is possible.
            ‍
            <br><br><strong>Questions & Concerns</strong><br>
            If you have any questions or comments, or if you have a concern about the way in which we have handled any
            privacy
            matter, please email us at hellofready@gmail.com.
